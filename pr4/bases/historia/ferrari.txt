Ferrari, one of the most iconic names in the world of motorsport and automotive engineering, was founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari. The company originally started as Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, and its first car, the 125 S, made its debut in 1947. Over the years, Ferrari has become synonymous with luxury, speed, and exceptional engineering, particularly in the realm of Formula 1 racing.

Ferrari’s Formula 1 team, Scuderia Ferrari, holds the record as the oldest and most successful team in the history of the sport. It has won numerous Constructors’ Championships and Drivers’ Championships, with some of the most legendary drivers in the sport's history wearing its colors. Famous Ferrari drivers include Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, Niki Lauda, Michael Schumacher, and Sebastian Vettel. Michael Schumacher, in particular, became a symbol of Ferrari’s dominance in F1, winning five consecutive Drivers’ Championships with the team between 2000 and 2004.
