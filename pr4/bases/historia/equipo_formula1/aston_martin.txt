Aston Martin's Formula 1 involvement dates back to the 1950s when the company made a brief foray into the sport as a constructor. After a long hiatus, Aston Martin returned to F1 in 2021 under the name Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One Team, marking a new chapter in its motorsport history. While Aston Martin has not yet achieved the same level of dominance in F1 as some of its competitors, its presence continues to grow, and the team is seen as a rising force in the sport.
