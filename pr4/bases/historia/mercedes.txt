Mercedes-Benz, founded in 1926 by the merging of Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG), is one of the most prestigious and renowned automotive brands in the world. Known for its luxury, performance, and innovative technology, Mercedes-Benz has a rich history in both the automotive industry and motorsport. The brand’s presence in Formula 1 dates back to the early days of the sport, but it was in 1954 that Mercedes-Benz made its major mark in F1 with the legendary Mercedes W196, driven by Juan Manuel Fangio.

Mercedes-Benz has been a major force in Formula 1, both as a constructor and an engine supplier. The Mercedes F1 team, also known as Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, has dominated much of the modern era, particularly since 2014. The team’s success is highlighted by the incredible achievements of Nico Rosberg, who became Formula 1 World Champion in 2016.
