Mercedes-Benz, founded in 1926 by the merging of Benz & Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG), is one of the most prestigious and renowned automotive brands in the world. Known for its luxury, performance, and innovative technology, Mercedes-Benz has a rich history in both the automotive industry and motorsport. The brandâ€™s presence in Formula 1 dates back to the early days of the sport, but it was in 1954 that Mercedes-Benz made its major mark in F1 with the legendary Mercedes W196, driven by Juan Manuel Fangio.
