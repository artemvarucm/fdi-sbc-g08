Ferrari, one of the most iconic names in the world of motorsport and automotive engineering, was founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari. The company originally started as Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, and its first car, the 125 S, made its debut in 1947. Over the years, Ferrari has become synonymous with luxury, speed, and exceptional engineering, particularly in the realm of Formula 1 racing.
