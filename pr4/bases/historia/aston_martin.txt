Aston Martin, founded in 1913 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford, is a British luxury automobile manufacturer renowned for its stunning craftsmanship, performance, and elegance. The brand has long been associated with sophistication, often linked to James Bond movies, where its cars are portrayed as symbols of both power and luxury. Over the years, Aston Martin has created some of the most iconic cars in automotive history, and its presence in motorsport has contributed significantly to its legendary status.

Aston Martin's Formula 1 involvement dates back to the 1950s when the company made a brief foray into the sport as a constructor. After a long hiatus, Aston Martin returned to F1 in 2021 under the name Aston Martin Cognizant Formula One Team, marking a new chapter in its motorsport history. While Aston Martin has not yet achieved the same level of dominance in F1 as some of its competitors, its presence continues to grow, and the team is seen as a rising force in the sport.
