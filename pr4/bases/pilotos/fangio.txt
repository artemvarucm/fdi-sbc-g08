Juan Manuel Fangio, born on June 24, 1911, in Balcarce, Argentina, is considered one of the greatest drivers in the history of Formula 1. Nicknamed "El Chueco," Fangio stood out not only for his natural talent but also for his intelligence behind the wheel and ability to adapt to different cars and teams.
