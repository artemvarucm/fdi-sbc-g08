Nico Rosberg, born on June 27, 1985, in Wiesbaden, Germany, raced alongside Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes from 2010 to 2016. Rosberg was a key player in Mercedesâ€™ dominance in the turbo-hybrid era, and in 2016, he achieved the ultimate success by winning his first and only Formula 1 World Championship. Rosberg retired immediately after his title win, making him one of the few drivers in history to retire as World Champion.
