The Ferrari SF90 Stradale is a groundbreaking plug-in hybrid hypercar powered by a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine paired with three electric motors, producing a combined output of 986 horsepower. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 340 km/h. As Ferrari’s first plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV), the SF90 Stradale represents a milestone in Ferrari’s electrification journey.

Its name pays homage to Ferrari's 90th anniversary and the Scuderia Ferrari Formula 1 team. Adding to its innovation, the car features Ferrari’s eSSC (electronic Side Slip Control), which optimizes traction by independently controlling the torque to the wheels.
