The Ferrari LaFerrari is a limited-production hybrid hypercar powered by a 6.3-liter V12 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 950 horsepower. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in under 2.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 350 km/h.

Designed as Ferrari’s first hybrid hypercar, it uses HY-KERS hybrid technology derived directly from Formula 1, blending blistering performance with cutting-edge innovation. Limited to just 499 coupe models and 210 Aperta versions, the LaFerrari is also Ferrari’s first road car not styled by Pininfarina in decades.
