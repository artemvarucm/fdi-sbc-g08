The Aston Martin Valkyrie is a revolutionary hypercar developed in collaboration with Red Bull Racing, powered by a 6.5-liter naturally aspirated V12 engine producing an astonishing 1,160 horsepower. With a weight of just 1,030 kg and advanced active aerodynamics, it generates up to 1,800 kg of downforce at high speeds. The Valkyrie can reach 0 to 100 km/h in under 2.5 seconds and achieve a top speed of over 400 km/h, making it one of the closest road-legal experiences to driving an F1 car.
