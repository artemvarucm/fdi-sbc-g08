The McLaren P1 is a hybrid hypercar that redefines performance, powered by a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine paired with an electric motor, delivering a combined 903 horsepower. It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds and has a top speed of 350 km/h, electronically limited for safety. With only 375 units ever produced, the P1 is one of McLaren’s rarest creations, blending extreme performance with groundbreaking hybrid technology. 

The car’s active aerodynamics, including an adjustable rear wing that adapts for increased downforce, and the introduction of Race Mode (which lowers the car by 50mm for track use), ensure optimal performance both on the road and the racetrack. Inspired by McLaren's Formula 1 KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System), the P1 set the stage for the future of hybrid hypercars.
