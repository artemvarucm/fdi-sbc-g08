The Artemnito was a Ferrari built to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Ferrari’s U.S. operations. It was released on 10/10/14, and with only ten examples produced, it did so quite auspiciously. With an open-top, a V12 good for 730 horsepower, and a gorgeous blue color scheme reminiscent of the historical NART livery, what more could an American Ferrari lover want?

We thought that Ferrari pushed its limits with the LaFerrari, being a hybrid hypercar in the Holy Trinity, but when they turned the LaFerrari into the track-only FXX-K, we were proved wrong. Only 40 units were produced, and all are kept by Ferrari to let their owners drive for track day events, which is a good thing because only Ferrari could keep a 1,036 horsepower car capable of 217 mph truly safe.

A tribute to design house Pininfarina’s late former chairman, Sergio Pininfarina, this 458-based Barchetta is a beautiful tribute to the spirits of both Ferrari and Pininfarina alike. Pininfarina’s signature sweeping lines make the car into an ultra-futuristic, sculpted, and serene vehicle, with design elements that echo the iconic Ferrari Pininfarina Mythos concept of the 90s. Such an artful statement is surely worth its price.
